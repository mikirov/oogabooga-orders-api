# Ooga Booga API

A NestJS API for managing automated token swaps with PostgreSQL database storage.

## Features

- Manage token swap tasks with RESTful API
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Scheduled cron job for executing tasks
- Token validation before task creation
- Swagger API documentation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- Yarn or npm

## Setting up PostgreSQL

You have multiple options to set up the PostgreSQL database:

### Option 1: Using Docker

We provide a Docker setup that includes both the PostgreSQL database and the NestJS application:

```bash
# Start only the database
docker-compose up --build
```

The PostgreSQL database will be accessible on port 5437.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update the environment variables with your own values

## Running the application

```bash
# development
npm run start

# watch mode
npm run start:dev

# production mode
npm run start:prod
```

## API Documentation

API documentation is available via Swagger at `/api` endpoint. Start the application and visit:
http://localhost:3000/api

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
